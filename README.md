# Cybersecurity Scenario

## Task 1: Threat Intelligence Report

### Types of Attacks That Could Be Used:
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers may exploit weaknesses in input validation mechanisms to inject malicious SQL queries, allowing them to manipulate or control the backend database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If user inputs are not properly sanitized, attackers can embed malicious scripts within web pages, which are then executed when viewed by other users, potentially compromising their sessions or data.
- **Command Injection:** This occurs when an application passes unsafe, user-supplied data (such as form inputs, cookies, or HTTP headers) to a system shell, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Once initial access is obtained, attackers can exploit additional vulnerabilities to elevate their privileges, gaining higher-level permissions and greater control over the system.

### Explanation of Vulnerability Exploitation:
An unpatched vulnerability, such as one found in the web framework or libraries utilized by the application, may lack sufficient safeguards against common attacks. For example, if the framework is outdated, it might fail to properly validate input, thereby exposing the system to threats like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### Preventive Measures:
- **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management:** Utilize automated tools to routinely scan for vulnerabilities across the application. Implement a robust patch management process to ensure that security patches and updates are applied promptly, minimizing exposure to known risks.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Implement Web Application Firewalls to monitor, filter, and block malicious traffic directed at your web applications. A WAF can detect and mitigate common attacks like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), providing an additional layer of defense.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Ensure that developers are trained in secure coding practices, focusing on preventing common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and command injection. Adopting a secure development lifecycle (SDL) can help integrate security into the development process from the start.

## Task 2: Incident Response Plan

### Incident Response Plan for Addressing the Breach:
- **Identification:** Utilize AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to track the origin and method of the breach. These tools can help pinpoint the exact entry point and actions taken by the attackers, allowing for a clear understanding of how the breach occurred.
- **Containment:**
  - *Short-term:* Immediately isolate the compromised systems by adjusting security groups or network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic. This limits further damage while the breach is being assessed.
  - *Long-term:* Develop patches or make configuration changes to eliminate the vulnerability that was exploited. Ensure that these changes are thoroughly tested before reintroducing systems to the network.
- **Eradication:** Remove any malicious code, such as backdoors or malware, installed by the attackers. Additionally, revert any unauthorized changes made during the breach to restore system integrity.
- **Recovery:** After confirming that the systems are no longer vulnerable, restore the affected components from secure backups. Gradually bring services back online, closely monitoring for any signs of continued attacker activity.
- **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a post-incident review (post-mortem) to identify the root cause of the breach and evaluate the effectiveness of the response. Use this analysis to improve security measures and refine the incident response plan to prevent future occurrences.

## Task 3: Network Security Measures

### Recommended Network Security Measures:
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** To safeguard against malicious activities, it is recommended to deploy solutions like AWS Network Firewall or integrate third-party IDS/IPS tools. These systems continuously monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and actively block or mitigate threats before they can cause harm.
- **Firewalls and Network Segmentation:** Leverage AWS security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to design a segmented network structure. This approach minimizes the potential impact of any security breach by limiting unauthorized access to other parts of the network. Proper segmentation ensures that even if a part of the network is compromised, the damage is contained.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Adopt a Zero Trust model by implementing strict user authentication and authorization controls through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This ensures that every application and system access request is authenticated, verified, and authorized, regardless of whether the request originates inside or outside the network. In this model, no one is implicitly trusted, enhancing overall security.

# Container Security Implementation

## Task 1: Docker Security Best Practices

### Five Best Practices for Docker Security:
1. **Use Trusted Base Images:** Always source images from official or verified repositories, such as Docker Hubâ€™s official library. This reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into your environment, ensuring you're starting from a secure, well-maintained foundation.
2. **Keep Images Minimal:** Opt for minimal base images which have fewer components and therefore a smaller attack surface. By only including necessary dependencies, you decrease the number of potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Run Containers as Non-Root:** Whenever possible, run containers with a non-root user. Running containers as root gives unnecessary privileges to processes inside the container, increasing the risk of security breaches. Restricting permissions minimizes potential damage in the event of a compromise.
4. **Use Read-Only Filesystems:** If applicable, configure container filesystems as read-only using the `--read-only` flag. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the container, they cannot modify or tamper with files, offering an additional layer of protection.
5. **Utilize Docker Secrets:** Safely manage sensitive information such as passwords and API keys by using Docker Secrets. Avoid embedding these secrets directly in the image or passing them through environment variables, as this exposes them to security risks.

### Implementation of a Docker Security Practice in a Dockerfile (Non-Root User):
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run the application in a non-root user context
RUN useradd -m myuser
USER myuser

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# Kubernetes Security Configuration

## Task 2: Key Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC manages access to the Kubernetes API, allowing you to define which users or services can perform specific actions. It helps ensure that only authorized entities can access and modify your Kubernetes resources, limiting the potential for unauthorized changes or breaches.

### Network Policies
Network Policies define how pods can communicate with each other and external services. By specifying which traffic is allowed or denied between groups of pods or network endpoints, you can limit exposure and reduce the attack surface within your cluster.

### Pod Security Policies (PSP)
Pod Security Policies govern various security-related aspects of pod configuration. For example, they can enforce restrictions like running pods as non-root users, preventing privilege escalation, and controlling access to host resources. These policies ensure that your pods operate in a secure and controlled manner.

### Kubernetes YAML Configuration with securityContext
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-app-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: secure-app-container
    image: secureapp:1.0
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

# Task 3: IaaS Security Measures

## Explanation of IaaS and Its Security Implications
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, delivered over the internet. This model allows businesses to rent infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis without the need to manage physical hardware. While IaaS offers flexibility and scalability, it introduces security responsibilities for both the provider and the customer.

## Key Security Implications

### Shared Responsibility Model
In IaaS, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the physical infrastructure, including hardware, network, and the virtualization layer. However, the customer must manage the security of the operating systems, applications, and data running on top of the IaaS environment. This includes patching systems, monitoring logs, and managing access controls.

### Data Security
To protect sensitive information, it is essential to encrypt data both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.

### Network Security
Properly configuring network security features such as firewalls, security groups, and network access control lists (ACLs) is critical to protecting the perimeter and internal communications. These controls help regulate what traffic is allowed into and out of your cloud infrastructure, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Access Controls
Strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), should be enforced. Additionally, following the principle of least privilege ensures that users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks, minimizing the risk of insider threats or external attacks.

By applying these measures, organizations can securely manage their IaaS environments while protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with industry standards.
